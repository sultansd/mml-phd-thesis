Hello!
<br/>
This repository contains the supplemented files needed to replicate/apply the work of the mml-phd-thesis. Not all listed files in the appendices A-I are available in this specific repository at this moment because the thesis and its relevant papers are not yet published. However, the complete list of the files are currently available in a private version of this repository. So, to have an access to such private repository, I beg your patience and time and I ask you please to send your GitHub username and your name to the following emails:
<ul>
  <li>if you are a current collaborator or a user of the ARQ framework, please send your information to my email: sul.sfd [at] gmail.com </li>
  <li>if you are my PhD examiner, please send your information to my supervisor's email: nenadic [at] manchester.ac.uk </li>
</ul>

Thank you very much!
